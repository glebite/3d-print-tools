## wingnutwrench.FCStd:  
### Description:  
This is a simple socket wrench for tightening small nuts.  Allows for the bolt to slide through while prototyping.  
  
### Suggestions:  
* Port it to OpenSCAD and make it parametric!
* Add a small hole through one of the wings to attach it to a wire loop so it doesn't get lost easily.

## basemodel.FCStd:
### Description:
I want to build vertically - so this allows me to attach things to an aluminum post.
First build has gone well - the aluminum post that I have was cut easily by my saw but it's a really tight fit into the base.  It's there!
Note that the threaded rod that I have right now is too big - 5% infill on the print will snap!  I had to glue the ring base connector back together and it's kind of annoying because I'll have to run out and get that and new nuts and washers tomorrow.

Threaded rods, nuts, washers have been acquired - will assemble, pull the wiring to and arduino to drive the plater and laser and a raspberry pi for the camera
acquisition and point cloud generation.

## hoodieclip.FCStd:
### Description:
Start of hoodie LED clips or arch for lighting effects or hiding.  I think the arch idea is better as the hoodie clips could still come apart or de-wired and be a disappointment.  I'd rather go for working than not.
