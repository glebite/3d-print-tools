## wingnutwrench.FCStd:  
### Description:  
This is a simple socket wrench for tightening small nuts.  Allows for the bolt to slide through while prototyping.  
  
### Suggestions:  
* Port it to OpenSCAD and make it parametric!
* Add a small hole through one of the wings to attach it to a wire loop so it doesn't get lost easily.
